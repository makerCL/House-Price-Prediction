# Kaggle Machine Learning Competitions
Kaggle Hosts Machine Learning Competitions to support people learning Data Science. A data set is posted under a competition, then people are put on a public leader board (often scored by lowest mean absolute error) to see how they stack up against others! Included here are submissions to some of the data sets that I have created models for.
